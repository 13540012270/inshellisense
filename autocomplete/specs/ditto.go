This is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later, and is only intended to be used in installation and backup scenarios that involve system files. Since files using HFS+ compression are not readable on versions of Mac OS X earlier than 10.6, this flag should not be used when dealing with non-system files or other user-generated content that will be used on a version of Mac OS X earlier than 10.6`,

			Description: `Sets the compression level to use when creating a PKZip archive. The compression level can be set from 0 to 9, where 0 represents no compression, and 9 represents optimal (slowest) compression. By default, ditto will use the default compression level as defined by zlib`,
