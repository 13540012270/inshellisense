jump host described by destination and then establishing a TCP
forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.  Multiple jump
hops may be specified separated by comma characters.  This is a
shortcut to specify a ProxyJump configuration directive.  This

from a remote host to a local directory scp checks that the
received filenames match those requested on the command-line to
prevent the remote end from sending unexpected or unwanted files.

interpret filename wildcards, these checks may cause wanted files
to be rejected.  This option disables these checks at the expense
of fully trusting that the server will not send unexpected
filenames`,
